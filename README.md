# csp-analyzer

A (very poorly written) wrapper for `https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com`. Why? I wanted something I could use on the command line and didn't want to use javascript/typescript. Also wanted something that could sort my findings for me easier.

## Installation

Clone the directory and run:

```
pipx install .
```

## Usage

```
scp-analyzer https://example.com [-h] target
```
